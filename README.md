# Platformer
Java platformer project, mostly to learn and improve, but also to make an awesome game!

Greetings, thanks for stopping by!

As you can see this is the README for my platformer game that I am currently developing in Java (note: not JavaScript).

As it is written in Java it will also require you to have Java installed in order to run it, which can be found here:
https://java.com/en/download/

Your operative system shouldn't matter for as long as you have Java, although I'm developing it in Windows it should work fine in Linux as well.

(To be continued as I learn more about what you might need and how to more easily implement means for you to test the project.)
